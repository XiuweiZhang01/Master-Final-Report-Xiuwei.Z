# MSc Thesis: Covert Quantum Rangefinding in High-Noise Environments

This repository contains my **MSc dissertation and poster** completed at the  
**University of Bristol (2023.09 – 2025.01)**, under the supervision of **Prof. John Rarity**.

## Project Overview
This research investigates **quantum-inspired covert rangefinding** techniques that combine  
the **noise resilience of quantum illumination** with the **brightness of classical sources**.  

- Developed a **semiclassical approach** using **energy–time correlation** for long-range detection.  
- Designed an **automated acquisition system** for real-time photon detection and data parsing.  
- Validated the approach in **high-noise outdoor environments**, demonstrating covert operation even under strong solar background.  
- Applications include **secure remote sensing**, **quantum communications**, and **defense technologies**.
